Boldly highlight the total cooking time (h1) to draw attention to the critical information.
Ingredient List Styling:

Preparation Steps Styling:

Integrate a gray color for the time duration to enhance the user's focus on the time required for each step.
External Link Styling:
Enhance the appearance of external links by giving them a SeaGreen color, making them easily recognizable.
Font Family:
Apply the Helvetica font family to headers (h1, h2), paragraphs (p), and list items (li) for a cohesive and professional appearance.
